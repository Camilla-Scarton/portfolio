# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it.
      # This is essential for accessing your project files.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment.
      # Specify the Node.js version you are using for your React project.
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18' # You can change this to your preferred Node.js version (e.g., '18', '22')

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies.
      # This runs 'npm install' or 'yarn install' based on your lock file.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install # Or 'yarn install' if you use Yarn

      # Step 4: Build the React project for production.
      # This typically creates a 'build' folder with optimized static assets.
      - name: Build React app
        run: npm run build # Or 'yarn build' if you use Yarn

      # Step 5: Deploy the built application to GitHub Pages.
      # This action pushes the 'build' directory content to the 'gh-pages' branch.
